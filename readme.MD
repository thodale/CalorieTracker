# Calorie Tracker
Calorie Tracker is a C# .NET application that helps users track their calorie intake based on the macronutrients in their meals. 
This project was started to compliment my current portfolio, since most of my previous development experience comes from in-house projects.

The project is early and is still lacking features.  

## Current Features

- Adding ingredients and composing meals.
- Calculate total calories in a dish based on its ingredients.
- Breakdown of calories from different macronutrients: Protein, Carbohydrates, Fat, and Alcohol.

## Planned Features
- Add a user interface
- Introduce a database to store ingredients and meals.
- Add a feature to track daily calorie intake.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
- C# .NET
- .NET MAUI
- Jetbrains Rider

## Setup
To run this project, clone the repository in a supported IDE configure your run settings to run the app.
