# Kalorie
Kalorie is a C# .NET application built with MAUI that helps users track their calorie intake based on the macronutrients in their meals. You can scan for millions of meals, ingredients and products all over the world to get information about their nutritional values.

## Why?
Most calorie trackers out there are slow and has a convoluted UI. My goal with this project is to create a fast and simple calorie tracker, and just that. No subscriptions, no ads, no unnecessary features. Only the calories & macros in your meals.

## Current Features
- Adding ingredients and composing meals.
- Gives you an overview of your calories and macros in your currently tracked meals.
- Live access to the OpenFoodFacts database.

## Planned Features
- Improve user interface
- Add more statistics like average calorie and macro intake
- Let users calculate their TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and use it as a reference point.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
- C# .NET 8.0
- .NET MAUI
- Jetbrains Rider

## Setup
To currently run this project, clone the repository in a supported IDE and hit play.
